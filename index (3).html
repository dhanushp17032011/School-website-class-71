<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" > At first glance one might tend to overlook the humble school canteen, but on reflection I think most people would agree that the canteen is one of the most important parts of school life.  In this post I will consider two ways in which school canteens play indispensable roles in the life and functioning of schools.  School administrators need to have a definite canteen policy, must establish canteen committees to seek to improve service and food quality and must work closely with canteen operators.

  The two main ways in which school canteens have an impact on school life are in supporting teaching through proper nutrition and health practices; including the provision of special dietary requirements for some students and staff, and in being sectors of schools which can easily become trouble zones if specific measures are not put in place to prevent this.

The parents get to know the time when the child is boarded or alighted from the bus, the time of departure of the bus and its arrival times.

  The portal for school administrators helps them to track the bus location and view every bus stop on a map. They can send alerts to parents in case of emergencies. Drivers’ portal which contains student lists with all details.
  
  The app provides a beacon for students using Bluetooth (BLE). This is useful in letting administrators, parents, and drivers know as to when a student enters or exits the bus.
  
  The information transmitted to and from the beacon is secure and encrypted to prevent unauthorized persons from boarding the bus, ensuring high levels of security.
